# Experimental "Spikes"

- Short lived, "throw-away" code.
- Concepts derived from within `/spikes` are harvested and refactored into `/sys` 
  (or other "production quality code" locations).

**IMPORTANT**  
Unlike all other folders in this repo, the quality of the code in products within "spikes" is not to
be considered "systems grade engineering quality" code.  
These are quick, exploratory, experimental, throw-away [sketches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Buxton).

### Terminology

>> A spike is a product development method originating from extreme programming that uses the 
simplest possible program to explore potential solutions.[1] It is used to determine how much 
work will be required to solve or work around a software issue.
